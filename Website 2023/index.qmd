:::{#hero-heading}
<br />

​I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Philosophy, Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf. I am also Lecturer at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of the Republic, associated researcher (Lvl 1) at [ANII](https://www.anii.org.uy), and external member of the [Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). Before that, I was a NeuroMind Fellow at Ruhr-Universität Bochum working with Peter Brössel in Emmy Noether Research Group ["From Perception To Belief and Back Again"](https://fromperceptiontobelief.wordpress.com).

My work is focused on the foundations of cognitive science. In particular, I research about theories of reasoning and formal models of concepts. Other academic interests are philosophy of language (inferentialism), non-classical logic (relevant logics), social epistemology, and general philosophy of science (conceptual change and scientific rationality). 

I studied philosophy, mathematical logic, and cognitive science at the University of the Republic, at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. I did my PhD under the supervision of Stephan Hartmann and Max Kistler at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (LMU) and at the [Institut d'Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences et des Techniques](https://ihpst.pantheonsorbonne.fr)(Paris 1/CNRS).
