I am also Lecturer at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of the Republic, associated researcher (Lvl 1) at ANII, and external member of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy\nMy work is focused on the foundations of cognitive science. In particular, I research about theories of reasoning and formal models of concepts. Other academic interests are philosophy of language (inferentialism), non-classical logic (relevant logics), social epistemology, and general philosophy of science (conceptual change and scientific rationality).\nI studied philosophy, mathematical logic, and cognitive science at the University of the Republic, at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität.
